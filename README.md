# E-News-express---Statistics

## Project overview
This project focuses on the application of statistical methods and data analysis techniques to address real-world data-driven problems. It explores various statistical concepts, hypothesis testing methods, and data visualization techniques to draw meaningful insights from data.

## Key features 
* *__Descriptive Statistics:__* Provides a summary of data characteristics, including measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation).
* *__Inferential Statistics:__* Includes hypothesis testing (e.g.,z-tests, t-tests for equality and no equality of variances, ANOVA test for comaring the mean of multiple groups,Chi square test for independence, One proportion z-test, Shapiro test, Levene test) to make inferences about the population from sample data.

## Hypothesis tests performed :
* __*Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than the old landing page?*__
* __*Is the conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the landing page and get converted) for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?*__
* __*Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?*__
* __*Is the mean time spent on the new page same for the different language users?*__
